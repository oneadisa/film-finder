# Film-Finder

 This is a list of TV shows and movies and want to get recommendations for what to watch next, but aren’t sure where to look.

 In this project, I used my knowledge of HTTP requests and asynchronous JavaScript to create a movie discovery app that will recommend random movies by genre. You’ll be able to choose from several genres, and like or dislike a movie to get another suggestion when you run it onyour broswer.
